# Fraction-Add 

This console application prompts for two fractions, adds them, and displays the sum with the lowest common denominator. 

## Project Details

A program that asks the user for two fractions, adds them, and displays the result so that the numerator and denominator have no common factor. For example, when adding 3/4 and 5/6, the result is 19/12. Methods are utilized for obtaining the numerator and denominator of strings such as "3/4" from the user and then computing the greatest common divisor of two integers.
